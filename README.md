# Vintage Counter Game!

Hello everyone! I'm excited to share with you my first countdown application, developed as part of my university project. I designed it to resemble an old-school console, aiming to evoke a vintage and retro vibe. I hope you enjoy it!

# About my application
Introducing my countdown application! You have the power to increment or decrement the counter by 1 or 2 with ease. I've also included an ON/OFF button and a reset option to enhance the user experience. But that's not all! Recently, I've added four arrow buttons for some extra fun â€“ they allow you to change the color of the console. Dive in and enjoy the interactive experience!

# Directory Structure
Assets Folder: Inside, you'll find various subfolders:
CSS
Images
Sass
and a JavaScript folder;
Node Modules: This directory contains essential files related to Bootstrap and JavaScript.
Index File: This is the entry point of my application. 
Package.json: This file holds information about the project's dependencies and scripts.
